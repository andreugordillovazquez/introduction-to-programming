# Introduction to Programming: Lab 1 - Control Structures

## Exercise 1

Write a program that calculates the minimum breakdown in banknotes and coins of an exact amount of euros. There are 500€, 200€, 100€, 50€, 20€, 10€ and 5€ bills and 2€ and 1€ coins. For example, if we want to know the breakdown of €434, the program will display the following result:
```
2 bills of 200€, 1 bill of 20€, 1 bill of 10€ and 2 coins of 2€
```
Have the program prompt for amounts until the user enters a negative amount, in which case the program will terminate.
